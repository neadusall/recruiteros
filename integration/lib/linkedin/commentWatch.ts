/**
 * RecruitersOS · LinkedIn Market Radar ("who is posting that they're hiring?")
 *
 * OTHER PEOPLE'S posts are the market (owner decision 2026-08-12: the radar
 * never scans the owner's own posts). Every tick (15 min by default):
 *
 *   1. one keyword search across ALL of LinkedIn's posts (rotating bank:
 *      "we are hiring", "looking to hire", ... - editable per workspace),
 *   2. every hit is gated: hiring intent in the text, a person (not a
 *      company page), decision-maker title, not a peer firm, DNC/cooldown,
 *   3. open-profile check picks the channel, and
 *   4. a hyper-targeted direct message is drafted off THEIR post.
 *
 * The commenter machinery below (replies/connects on items with kind
 * "commenter") remains for items already captured, but the scan no longer
 * creates them.
 *
 * NOTHING posts on its own: everything waits for one-tap approval in the
 * LinkedIn tab and goes out through requestLinkedInAction, so account caps,
 * health and the ledger all apply.
 *
 * HOT commenters (hiring decision-maker AND open roles) get BOTH a
 * connection-note draft and a reply draft, each independently one-tap
 * approvable; no forced ordering (owner decision 2026-08-12).
 *
 * SECOND LANE, "market scan" (owner decision 2026-08-12): keyword searches
 * across ALL of LinkedIn's posts (backend keyword bank, editable per
 * workspace) find hiring managers posting about talent they need. Each match
 * is gated (decision-maker title, hiring intent in the post, not a peer
 * firm, DNC) and then gets a hyper-targeted direct message built off their
 * post. Open profiles get it as a plain direct message (NEVER InMail); the
 * same personalized text goes as a connection note when their profile
 * cannot receive a stranger's DM.

Rules:
- Respond to the SUBSTANCE of their comment: extend their point with a concrete observation from recruiting/staffing, offer a short counterpoint, or ask them one genuine question back. Never restate their comment.
- 10 to 35 words. One or two sentences. No exclamation marks, no emoji, no hashtags, no long dashes.
- Address them by first name only when it reads naturally; skipping the name is fine.
- Banned openers: "Thanks for", "Great point", "Love this", "So true", "Appreciate you", "Couldn't agree more", "Spot on".
- Banned words: "insightful", "resonate", "game-changer", "leverage", "delve", "align".
- Never mention AI, never pitch services, never link, never suggest connecting or a call. The only goal is one more genuine exchange in the thread.
Return ONLY the reply text, nothing else.`;

- Reference their comment naturally (their take under the post), not their profile or their company.
- No pitch, no links, no "synergies", no emoji, no long dashes, no mention of hiring, roles, or services. Connecting to keep talking is the whole message.
- Never mention AI.

The recipient is a hiring decision-maker who just published a LinkedIn post about a role they need to fill or talent they are looking for; this message goes straight to their inbox while the post is fresh.

Rules:
- Anchor the message in the SPECIFIC need from their post: the exact role, team, or hiring challenge they described, in their own framing. Never summarize their post back, never flatter.
- One low-key line that this exact kind of search is what the owner does all day; offering to send over a couple of strong profiles is allowed. No hard pitch, no links, no calendar ask, no "quick call".
- 40 to 80 words. Short paragraphs. No exclamation marks, no emoji, no hashtags, no long dashes.
- Banned openers: "Great post", "Love this", "Hope you're well", "I came across", "I saw your post". Banned words: "insightful", "resonate", "game-changer", "leverage", "delve", "align", "synergies".
