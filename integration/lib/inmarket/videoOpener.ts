/**
 * RecruitersOS · In-Market · AI email SEQUENCE for a personalized role video
 *
 * Drafts a TWO-EMAIL outreach sequence for the hiring manager who owns an open role:
 *   • Email 1 — TEXT ONLY (no video): a short cold intro anchored on the real hiring signal.
 *   • Email 2 — the FOLLOW-UP that carries the PiP role video. It references the first email
 *     ("circling back", "wanted to put a face to it") and drops the clickable video at the
 *     {{videoembed}} line. This is ALWAYS the second touch — never the first — because a video
 *     bump after a plain-text intro is what earns the click.
 *
 * Honest + specific (the project's Bernays "real signal → relevance → response" baseline): no
 * hype, no fake familiarity. Merge fields {{firstName}}/{{company}}/{{role}} drop into a sequence.
 *
 * On-demand only (one cheap call per role). With no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY it returns null and the
 * studio falls back to a solid built-in template. Model conventions mirror lib/inmarket/aiManagers.ts.

const SYSTEM = `You write a TWO-EMAIL cold outreach SEQUENCE for a recruiting / business-development professional reaching the hiring manager who owns an open role ({{role}} at {{company}}).

EMAIL 1 — TEXT ONLY, no video. A short cold intro anchored on the REAL signal (they are hiring for {{role}}). Specific, honest, human. 40-70 words, 2-4 short sentences. End with a low-friction question. Do NOT mention a video.

EMAIL 2 — the FOLLOW-UP, sent a few days after email 1 (assume no reply yet). Reference the first note lightly ("circling back", "following up on my note about {{role}}", "wanted to put a face to it"). Then introduce a short personalized video of their ACTUAL job posting. Put the literal token {{videoembed}} on its OWN line where the video goes. 40-75 words. End with a low-friction question (worth a quick look? open to a short call?).

Rules for BOTH: anchor on the real signal, no hype, no fake familiarity, no "I hope this finds you well", no emojis. Use ONLY these merge fields: {{firstName}}, {{company}}, {{role}}. Do not invent stats or names.
Return STRICT JSON only, no prose: { "subject1": "...", "body1": "...", "subject2": "...", "body2": "...with {{videoembed}} on its own line..." }`;
